### What?
A silly little party game I made for game a week 2023 and showcased at sabbatical gallery. Your goal is to be the last one balancing the rectangle on your nose... by any means nessicary. This is a tiny game that I made in a few hours but it probably has had the most joy to work ratio out of anything I've made!


### Tech?
Mediapipe + Bullet
