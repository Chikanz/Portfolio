### What?

A web platform that lets users search, preview and download thousands of low poly CC-BY and CC0 models. 
All models are free and hand picked, ready for use in games and other 3D projects.

The site features: 
- User accounts (likes, comments, lists, email verification etc)
- Model uploading, conversion and admin backend
- Realtime model preview with animations (that's faster than sketchfab)
- Patreon like donation system
- Model bundles (aka fancy lists)
- Affiliate ad serving system
- Search with filters + ranking system
- API + docs
- Custom CMS + newsletter system
- Lots of little things i'm probably forgetting (it's a big boy)


### Who?

Just me, and thousands of talented 3D artists who have uploaded their models to the site.


### Tech?

React, tailwind and MUI on the front end. Node, Express and Mongo on the back end. After.js is used for SSR (similar to next.js).

Hosted on a VPS that I manage using docker + caprover.
